# Goal
I want to create a setup where external  contractor, so I don't able to work in a Google cloud platform environment that is very similar to my production environment so that they are able to develop code, fix bugs  and I can then easily transfer that over to my production environment.
I want to be able to do this as programaticaly as possible

# Prior Approach


 Craig a new project in google cloud
 copy over to big query tables from the production environment to the test department as a part of copying the main tables. I'm also anonymizing the company names on a  name replacement look up see canonical_company_names directory for more detail
 I can create a service account that has owner permissions.  basically, I want the service account to be able to do anything it wants within the project like for example, set up a Cloud run environment
 I then generate a service account key â€“ json file
 then I create the get up repo, and I saved the service account json directly in the repo

Set up a new private github repo
Get the github name fo the contractor
Upload the files I want them to work with to the repo
for example see example_of_type_of_script_contractor_would_edit.py
Also, change all the variable references e.g. to bigqueyr tables to match the new dev environment


# Tables I want to copy

`assembled-wh.warehouse.ifms`
`assembled-wh.warehouse.ifms_consolidated`
`assembled-wh.warehouse.ifms_wa`
`assembled-wh.warehouse.ifms_consolidated_ttm_avg_data`
